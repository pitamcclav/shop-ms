# 🎉 MySQL Conversion Complete!

## ✅ What We Accomplished

Your Shop Management System has been successfully converted from SQLite to MySQL!

### Changes Made:

1. **Installed MySQL Driver**
   - Added `mysql2` package for MySQL connectivity
   - Supports connection pooling for better performance

2. **Created MySQL Database Layer** (`src/lib/db-mysql.ts`)
   - Connection pool with 10 concurrent connections
   - Automatic table initialization
   - Support for transactions

3. **Converted All API Routes**
   - ✅ Products API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - ✅ Purchases API (GET, POST with transactions)
   - ✅ Sales API (GET, POST with transactions)  
   - ✅ Stats API (Dashboard statistics)

4. **Created Setup Script** (`setup-mysql.ts`)
   - Automatically creates database
   - Creates all tables with proper schema
   - Includes indexes for performance

5. **Environment Configuration** (`.env.local`)
   - Database credentials
   - Easy switch between dev/production

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Local Development (XAMPP)
- **Database Created:** `shop_management`
- **Tables Created:** `products`, `purchases`, `sales`
- **Server Running:** http://localhost:3000
- **All API Routes Working:** ✓

### 📊 Database Schema
All tables created with:
- Proper data types (INT, DECIMAL, VARCHAR, TEXT, TIMESTAMP)
- Foreign key constraints
- Indexes for performance
- AUTO_INCREMENT for IDs
- Default values for unit conversion fields

## 📝 Next Steps for Production

### 1. **Test Locally** (Current Step)
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Create test products
   - Add stock purchases
   - Make some sales
   - Verify all features work

### 2. **Prepare for cPanel Deployment**
   - Create MySQL database on cPanel
   - Get database credentials from cPanel
   - Update `.env.production` with production credentials
   - Build the app: `npm run build`

### 3. **Deploy to cPanel**
   - Upload build files
   - Install dependencies
   - Run setup script on production
   - Start the application

### 4. **Point Subdomain**
   - Configure your subdomain to point to the app
   - Set up SSL certificate if needed

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Start MySQL tables (if needed again)
npx tsx setup-mysql.ts

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 📦 What's in Your Database

You can view your MySQL data using:
- **phpMyAdmin:** http://localhost/phpmyadmin
- **Database:** shop_management
- **Tables:** products, purchases, sales

---

## 🎨 Remaining Feature: Stock Batch Selection

The last user-requested feature is:
- **Concern #2:** Add checkboxes for old vs new stock selection (FIFO/LIFO)
- This allows choosing which batch to sell from when multiple purchases exist

Would you like to implement this feature now, or first test the MySQL conversion thoroughly?
