# Stock Management System - Enhancements

## What's Been Improved ‚ú®

### 1. **Better Form Colors** ‚úÖ
- All form inputs now have **black text** (`text-gray-900`)
- Labels are darker for better readability (`text-gray-700`)
- Much better contrast and visibility

### 2. **Advanced Stock Management** üì¶

#### New Database Schema:
- **Products Table**: Now tracks both `buying_price` and `selling_price`
- **Purchases Table**: NEW! Records every stock purchase with its buying price
- **Sales Table**: Enhanced with `selling_price` and `profit` tracking

#### How It Works:
1. **Initial Product Creation**: Set initial buying/selling prices
2. **Add Stock via Purchases**: 
   - Each purchase can have a different buying price
   - System calculates **weighted average** of buying prices
   - Example: 
     - Have 10 units at $5 each = $50
     - Buy 20 more at $6 each = $120
     - New average: $170 / 30 = $5.67 per unit

### 3. **Custom Selling Price with Alerts** üö®

#### Features:
- **Default Selling Price**: Uses product's standard price
- **Custom Price Option**: Checkbox to set custom price per sale
- **Real-time Profit Calculation**: Shows profit/loss immediately
- **Red Alert**: Big warning when selling below cost
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Must confirm sales below buying price
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: SELLING BELOW COST!
  Buying Price: $10.00
  Selling Price: $8.00
  Loss per unit: $2.00
  Total Loss: $20.00
  Do you want to continue?
  ```

### 5. **Smart Profit Tracking** üí∞

Every sale now calculates and stores:
```javascript
profit = (selling_price - buying_price) * quantity
```

- **Positive profit** = Green color ‚úÖ
- **Negative profit** = Red color (loss) ‚ùå
- Dashboard shows total profit across all sales

### 6. **Old vs New Stock Management** üìà

#### The Problem:
You buy stock at different prices over time. How do you track profit accurately?

#### Our Solution:
1. **Weighted Average Buying Price**:
   - Old stock: 50 units @ $10 = $500
   - New stock: 100 units @ $12 = $1,200
   - Average: $1,700 / 150 = $11.33 per unit

2. **When You Sell**:
   - Selling price: $15
   - Profit per unit: $15 - $11.33 = $3.67
   - Sell 10 units ‚Üí Profit: $36.70

3. **Purchase History**:
   - Every purchase is logged separately
   - You can see exactly what you paid and when
   - Helps with supplier tracking

#### Example Workflow:
```
Day 1: Create product "Widget"
  - Buying: $10
  - Selling: $15
  - Stock: 0

Day 2: Purchase 100 units @ $10 from "Supplier A"
  - Stock: 100
  - Avg Buying: $10

Day 3: Purchase 50 units @ $12 from "Supplier B"
  - Stock: 150
  - Avg Buying: $10.67 (weighted average)

Day 4: Sell 20 units @ $15 (standard price)
  - Revenue: $300
  - Profit: 20 √ó ($15 - $10.67) = $86.60

Day 5: Sell 10 units @ $13 (discounted)
  - Red Alert! Below cost
  - Revenue: $130
  - Profit: 10 √ó ($13 - $10.67) = $23.30
```
